# PyAdventure

All code can be found in `parser.py`. The adventure itself can be found in `adventure.fun` and can be edited with your favorite text editor. To run your adventure, first set up a virtual environment with PyPEG2 enabled:
```
> cd project_root
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install pypeg2
```

Then run the file thusly (using Python 2.7):

```
python ./parser.py
```

For instructions for setting up your own PyPEG2 project, see `protocol.md`.
